# VisualInertialSLAM
Estimating the trajectory of an autonomous vehicle and mapping key landmarks in its surroundings

In this project, I have implemented Visual Inertial SLAM using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). I have used measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a stereo camera. The intrinsic camera calibration and the extrinsic calibration between the two sensors, specifying the transformation from the left camera frame to the IMU frame, is assumed to be known and used in this project.
